# Linux File Permissions

## Overview
Linux uses file permissions to control who can read, write, or execute a file.
This is important for system security.

## Permission Types
- **r (read)**: view file content
- **w (write)**: modify file
- **x (execute)**: run a file or script

## Permission Groups
- **Owner**: the file owner
- **Group**: users in the same group
- **Others**: all other users

## Common Commands
- `ls -l` : view file permissions
- `chmod` : change permissions
- `chown` : change file owner
